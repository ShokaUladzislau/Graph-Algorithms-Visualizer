  # Graph-Algorithms Visualizer

  Graph-Algorithms Visualizer is a Java program that allows users to visualize the workings of several graph algorithms, including Depth-First search, Breadth-First search, Dijkstra, and Prim's algorithms. The program is built using the Swing framework, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

  ## Features

- Users can add and remove nodes and edges from the graph.
- The program allows users to run each of the algorithms and see the progress of the algorithm.
- The program also provides the ability to reset the graph to its original state.

 
 ## Usage

  The `ApplicationRunner` class is located in "Graph-Algorithms Visualizer -> task -> src -> visualizer".

- To add a vertex to the graph, click on the "Mode -> Add vertex" button and then click on the desired location in the graph.
- To add an edge between two nodes, click on the "Mode -> Add Edge" button and then click on the two nodes you want to connect.
- To remove a vertex or an edge, click on the "Mode -> Remove Edge" button and then click on the vertex or edge.
- To run an algorithm, select the algorithm from the dropdown menu and click on the algorithm's name. The algorithm's progress will be shown on the graph.
- To reset the graph to its original state, click on the "File -> New" button.
